# ros_odrive

Forked repo (work in progress) to make the original c++ ros driver for the odrive motor controller by [johnkok](https://github.com/johnkok/ros_odrive) work with two odrive boards and ros control. Used with a Hardware Interface for a 4 wheel hoverboard skid steer robot derived from [here](https://github.com/BenBurgessLimerick/odrive_cpp_ros) 

Driver is running over native odrive protocol on USB port.
